
##Approach:
Planning began with a wireframe of the board and other elements that I wanted to appear on the screen: game name, player name, score, tie score (see image 1). 
I then moved on to what I would like the board to do: show the player's piece when hovering over an open spot, have functioning buttons. 
Before I began coding, I worked exactly what my game shoudl be doing as if I were playing the game (see image 2). explanations of the technologies used, the approach taken, installation instructions,

##Unsolved problems:
When two players tie, the game does not automatically announce this. Also, the game does not give you the button to clear the board.
When hovering over an available square, you do not see their piece. Instead, I opted for changing the color of the square when the mouse hovers.
