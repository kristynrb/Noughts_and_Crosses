Approach:
Planning began with a wireframe of the board and other elements that I wanted to appear on the screen: game name, player name, score, tie score (see image 1).
I then moved on to what I would like the board to do: show the player's piece when hovering over an open spot, have functioning buttons.
Before I began coding, I worked exactly what my game shoudl be doing as if I were playing the game (see image 2). 
explanations of the technologies used, 
the approach taken, 
installation instructions, 

unsolved problems:
When two players tie, the game does not automatically announce this. Also, the game does not give you the button to clear the board.
